Use Wyse 60/120 for Wyse and other PCTERM terminals.\n
Use Wyse 370 for Wyse and other colour PCTERM terminals including older C192's.\n
Use IMSTERM for terminals running the IMSTERM protocol, eg PC's running IMSTERM, later versions of the C192 terminal, or one of IMS's network terminal emulators\n
Use DUMB only when none of the above are suitable. NB it gives only one DOS session, and limited support for applications"
