Notes on the WYSE 50 terminal driver for IMS MDOS
=================================================

Only 24 lines are displayed - the 25th is 'thrown away'. If the screen is
scrolled when in 25-line mode, blank lines will be scrolled up the screen
instead of the required text. To avoid this problem, the terminal sessions
should be configured as having the status line enabled (using CONFIG, or
SETUP for MDOS v7). Non-scrolling 25-line applications will work OK but
of course the last line will be invisible.

The PC's graphical characters are translated to the nearest equivalent on
the Wyse 50 - the line drawing characters are there (single lines only), as
are the shaded block characters. Accented characters are mapped to the
non-accented equivalent, and other characters converted as closely as
possible.

Inverse video is implemented using the 'protected' attribute of the
WYSE 50. Any text which would be displayed with a background colour of
anything other than black will be shown in inverse on the Wyse 50.

The function keys F1-F12 and the shifted versions are mapped to the PC
equivalents. The cursor keys are mapped to the PC arrow keys. Keys F13-F16
are used for miscellaneous Ctrl+Cursor keys as shown in the table below.

Because the arrow keys return simple control codes, there is no way
to distinguish between, say, Left arrow, Ctrl-H and BackSpace - all of
which return 08h. If your application needs to use a control code which
the Wyse 50 uses for another key, you can precede it with Funct: for instance
pressing Funct Ctrl-H will generate the scan codes for the Ctrl and H keys
rather than the left arrow key. Alternatively you can use the Esc key in
place of the Funct key.

If the screen display becomes corrupted, or when you first switch on the
terminal, you can request a screen refresh by pressing the 'Send' key.

If you have configured more than one DOS Session (Virtual Console) on the
terminal, you can switch between them by pressing Funct followed by a number
between 1 and 8.

The following is a list of special WYSE 50 keystrokes or sequences, and the
scan codes they are converted to:


WYSE 50 keys			PC Scan codes
============			=============
F1 - F12			F1 - F12
Shift F1-F12			Shift F1-F12
F13				Ctrl Left arrow
F14				Ctrl Right arrow
F15				Ctrl Up arrow
F16				Ctrl Down arrow
Shift F13			Ctrl Home
Shift F14			Ctrl End
Shift F15			Ctrl PgUp
Shift F16			Ctrl PgDn
Arrow keys			Arrow keys
Ctrl-H,J,K,L			Left,Down,Up,Right arrows
Backspace			Left arrow
Del				Backspace
Send				Screen refresh
Home				Home
Shift Home			End
Page Next			Page Down
Page Prev			Page Up
Tab				Tab
Ctrl-I				Tab
Shift Tab			Shift Tab
Clear Line			Ctrl-Y
Clear Screen			Ctrl-Y
Del Char			Del
Del Line			Del
Ins				Insert
Repl				Insert
Ins Char			Esc
Ins Line			Esc
Return				Enter
Ctrl-M				Enter

Funct 1-8			Switch DOS Session

Funct Ctrl-A..Z			Ctrl-A..Z
Esc Ctrl-A..Z			Ctrl-A..Z

Funct Esc			Esc
Esc Esc				Esc



When setting up the terminal (using the Shift-Setup keys) the following
configuration is suitable:

HANDSHAKE=DTR	SCREEN=80 	CURSOR=LINE 	BLINK?=ON	MODE=FDX
DATA BIT=8	STOP BIT=1	PARITY BIT=NONE	MODEM BAUD RATE=38400
BLK END=US/CR	AUTO NL=OFF	CR=CR		AUTO SCRL=ON	AUX BAUD R=9600
SCRL=JUMP	STATUS=OFF	S.SAVER=OFF	PROT=REV	TEST=OFF
KEYS?=US/UK	RET/ENTER=CR/CR	COMPATIBLE=WY50	ENHANCE=OFF

All the function keys MUST be set to their default (undefined) values,
otherwise they will not be translated correctly.


Instructions on using the Wyse 50 terminal driver with MDOS
===========================================================

If you have MDOS 7 or later
===========================

Copy the file IMSNONPC.SYS into directory \IMSMDOS\DRIVERS

Edit the file \IMSMDOS\DRIVERS\INTTERM.DDF:
	Copy the line starting 'choice "IMSTERM"...' in the 'Terminal
	Type' section, and modify the new line as follows:
		Replace "IMSTERM" with "Wyse 50"
		Replace 'termtype 0' with 'termtype 080h'

Run SETUP - on the screens where you can configure terminal types (Wyse 60/120,
Wyse 370, IMSTERM) you should now have the extra option of Wyse 50. Select
this on the appropriate ports, and choose suitable comms parameters. Make
sure the status line is enabled (though it will be invisible).

Add a line to MCONFIG.SYS in the root of the boot drive:
DEVICE=\IMSMDOS\DRIVERS\IMSNONPC.SYS

Reboot the machine, and you should be in business.
============================================================================


If you have IMS MDOS earlier than version 7
===========================================

Copy the file IMSNONPC.SYS into the \OSUTILS directory.

Running CONFIG should now give you the option of selecting Wyse 50 as a
terminal type - select this on the appropriate ports, and choose suitable
comms parameters. Make sure the status line is enabled (even though it will
be invisible).

Make sure the CCONFIG.SYS file contains the line:
DEVICE=\OSUTILS\IMSNONPC.SYS

Reboot.
